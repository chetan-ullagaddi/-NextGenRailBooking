## üîç How It Works

1. **User Registration & Login:** Passengers create accounts and log in securely.  
2. **Train Search & Schedule:** Users search trains by source, destination, and date.  
3. **Seat Availability:** Real-time checking of available seats on selected trains.  
4. **Booking Tickets:** Select preferred class and seats, then book tickets.  
5. **Ticket Management:** View, download, or cancel booked tickets.  
6. **Admin Dashboard:** Admin users can add/remove trains, update schedules, and monitor bookings.  

All data is stored securely in a relational database, ensuring consistency and reliability.
